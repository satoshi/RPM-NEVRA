RPM-NEVRA

NEVRA is the best format to describe an RPM with full details.  The problem is,
rpm's handling of epoch is different from how repoquery handles epoch.  rpm
omits the epoch when undefined, whereas repoquery thinks epoch was
insignificant.  This subtle difference leads to incomplete queries such as this:

    $ repoquery bind-9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64
    bind-32:9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64

In the above example, I had the bind package from rpm -qa, which omitted epoch
because it was undefined.  However, when I feed it to repoquery, it gave me back
with a package with epoch of 32.  This was an ambiguous query and the solution
is to ALWAYS specify the epoch in repoquery queries.

    use RPM::NEVRA;

    my $obj = RPM::NEVRA->new();
    my %info = $obj->parse_nevra('bind-32:9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64');
    print $info{epoch}; # prints 32

    my $is_nevra = $obj->is_nevra('bind-9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64'); # returns ( 0, 'epoch' ) since it is missing epoch
    my $str = $obj->convert_to_nevra('bind-9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64'); # returns 'bind-0:9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64'
