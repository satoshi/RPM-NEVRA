=head1 NAME

RPM::NEVRA - Parses, validates NEVRA format

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.0.3

=cut

our $VERSION = 'v0.0.3';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

NEVRA is the best format to describe an RPM with full details.  The problem is, rpm's handling of epoch is different
from how repoquery handles epoch.  rpm omits the epoch when undefined, whereas repoquery thinks epoch was insignificant.
This subtle difference leads to incomplete queries such as this:

    $ repoquery bind-9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64
    bind-32:9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64

In the above example, I had the bind package from rpm -qa, which omitted epoch because it was undefined.  However, when
I feed it to repoquery, it gave me back with a package with epoch of 32.  This was an ambiguous query and the solution
is to ALWAYS specify the epoch in repoquery queries.

    use RPM::NEVRA;

    my $obj = RPM::NEVRA->new();
    my %info = $obj->parse_nevra('bind-32:9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64');
    print $info{epoch}; # prints 32

    my $is_nevra = $obj->is_nevra('bind-9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64'); # returns ( 0, 'epoch' ) since it is missing epoch
    my $str = $obj->convert_to_nevra('bind-9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64'); # returns 'bind-0:9.10.2-2.P1.fc22.x86_64'

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Constructor, takes no argument.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    return bless {}, $class;
}

=head2 parse_nevra($str)

Takes a string and returns a hash of name, epoch, ver, rel and arch.

=cut

sub parse_nevra {
    my ( $self, $str ) = @_;

    my $arch = ( split( /\./, $str ) )[-1];
    $str =~ s/\.$arch$//;

    my $rel = ( split( /-/, $str ) )[-1];
    $str =~ s/-$rel$//;

    my $ver_str = ( split( /-/, $str ) )[-1];
    my ( $epoch, $ver ) = split( /:/, $ver_str );
    my $trimmer;

    if ( !defined($ver) ) {    # no epoch
        $ver     = $epoch;
        $epoch   = undef;
        $trimmer = $ver;
    }
    else {
        $trimmer = "$epoch:$ver";
    }
    $str =~ s/-\Q$trimmer\E//;

    my %info;
    @info{qw(name arch rel ver epoch)} = ( $str, $arch, $rel, $ver, $epoch );
    return %info;
}

=head2 is_nevra($str)

Takes a string and returns (1, undef) if NEVRA, (0, $missing_field) otherwise

=cut

sub is_nevra {
    my ( $self, $str ) = @_;
    my %info = $self->parse_nevra($str);
    for my $key ( keys %info ) {
        my $val = $info{$key};
        return ( 0, $key ) unless ( defined $val );
    }
    return ( 1, undef );
}

=head2 convert_to_nevra($str)

Takes a string, parses it and convert to nevra format.

=cut

sub convert_to_nevra {
    my ( $self, $str ) = @_;
    my %pieces = $self->parse_nevra($str);
    my ( $name, $epoch, $ver, $rel, $arch ) = @pieces{qw(name epoch ver rel arch)};
    $epoch = 0 if ( !$epoch );
    return "$name-$epoch:$ver-$rel.$arch";
}
